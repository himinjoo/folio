From this process, I could acknowledge main obstacles and problems of paper-based PRO trials. Knowing the problems and our potential users’ needs enabled me to have the proper mindset towards the problem space.

          My first official task for this project was mapping out the patient’s journey based off of the study protocol. Looking at the flow diagram, we could acknowledge the areas that required helps for our user to complete the 7-day journey sucessfully.

        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p class="bodycopy1">
          During the brainstorming session, we asked our selves many questions like “How might we reduce burden on our user side” and “How might we better motivate our end users?” In the beginning, we came up with (very) broad range of potential ideas, but we narrowed down and prioritized listed items. Then, we started setting our goals for the MVP version. While we dicussed, I roughly sketched how potential interface could be like so that we could visualize and spark the ideas more.<br><br>

          Initially, we imagined that the dashboard contains entrypoints to each day from day1 through the last day. However, this was not scalable solution for the future, becuase a clinical trial can lasts years while it could be a short study like this. Moving forward, we established the design principles to make sure that we were building a simple, scalable and functional product.

          To better understand the mindset of potential users and observe their initial reactions on our concept mocks, we interviewed 6 people and also interviewed 2 clinicians to gauge industry’s concerns and recommendations.

          <li>Patient’s privacy is crucial. We couldn’t ask patient’s personal data such as name and location</li>
          <li>Vertical visual analogue scale(VAS) can create bias. Horizontal design is reconmmended to pass industry reviews</li>

          I explored a few iterations of a lo-fi prototype and tested with six users which we then presented to the clinicians. I initially thought that featuring day-to-day journey on dashboard would help users understand where they are and where to go next. However, l then ultimately decided to create a version that was focused on today’s view with chronologically stacked lists of todos, from one that required an immediate action to others that are upcoming for the day. Lastly, I created cards with navigation that provides weekly overviews that provided clear guidance how our users could track and record their heath data.<br><br>
          I then narrowed in and selected those components that best solved for an intuitive dashboard experience to help guide users to complete assigned tasks for the day.

        This internship was my first time experiencing the entire product design process from  researching to prototyping end-to-end experience. By working with time-restricted medical stakeholders, I learned to prioritize ideas and tasks and communication behaviors to maximize work efficiency. Also, I learned cross-functional collaboration to boost productivity and creativity. More importantly, my excitement to design user experience that impacts people’s  lives grew tremendously.
