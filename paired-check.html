I used these two personas to keep myself aware of our user's needs and potential pain points while exploring new solutions.

Also, I can always reach out to clinicians and researchers for an help to hear their insights on what it is like to live with a certain type of disease.

        <p class="bodycopy1">
          Based off of the previously conducted diary study, I approached this problem from analyzing success and failures. This research was a major breakthrough for me and allowed me to focus the energy on creating the right experience, this time.  Key takeaways that we found were:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Users' schedules are the root cause of people having difficulty.</li>
          <li>Functionality does not accommodate user schedules resulting in usability issues.</li>
          <li>Value drivers are not emphasized.</li>

        <p class="italic">Old Experience | Customer Journey Map</p>
        Then, I had more clear vision in mind. To create more focused design solutions, I set the design principles to move forward with the process. <span style="font-weight:700;">The key design principles</span> to keep in mind were:
        </p>
        <ul class="description bodycopy1">
          <li><span style="font-weight:700;">Personalized</span>: By providing opportunities for personalization, people can discover tailored food habits.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight:700;">Asisstive</span>: By helping people to keep on track and reflect what & how they comsume, patients can build healthier haibts.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight:700;">Positive</span>: By projecting a positive tone with the interactions and design intervention, participants are subconsciously influenced to hold a positive attitude about the activity.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight:700;">Simple Interactions</span>: By utilizing simple interactions to reduce cognitive load, elderly patients can easily and intuitively move through the journey.</li>
      </ul>
        <p class="bodycopy1" style="padding-top: 56px;">Next, I moved forward by focusing on the strengths and opportunities of the approach to distinguish between where we are now and where we wish to be.</p>

          Although I used the existing framework for the beginning part, there were still many areas which <span style="font-weight:700;"> required customizations</span> for the feature specific. For example, the dashboad in-progress card was one of them. As diving deeper into it, I started asking myself questions:
        </p>

          <li>How can I bring <span style="font-weight:700;"> 'give-and-take' methodology</span> to this card?</li>

          <li>How might we motivate our users to log their meals with full descriptions?</li>
          <li>Then, how might we simplify the logging flow?</li>

        <p class="bodycopy1">
          After analyzing pros and cons of previous in-progress card, I started brainstorming. Although I planned to retain things that work well, I’d like to explore more options that would be more effective and intuitive.</p>

          First, a question came to my mind was that if we want to allow people to manually input their blood sugar(BS) measurement, although data automatically synced. My gut feeling said we should enable the manual log because there was time when the meter failed to sync data. I moved forward with both options: 1) BS data gets only updated automatically. In other words, users can only manually log their meals. 2) Manual logging is available until Paired Check is completed.<br><br>
