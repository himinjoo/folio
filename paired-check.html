            Onduo, a joint venture between Verily and Sanofi,  is a virtual diabetes clinic. Through the app, patients have access to lessons and activities that were <span style="font-weight:700;">designed to understand the impact of food and exercise on blood glucose</span>. This activity provides sufficient information to alert both the patient and their care team in the app if their diabetes control is declining, or to <span style="font-weight:700;">reinforce good behavior</span> if they’re maintaining good glycemic control.<br><br>

            More importantly, the defined UI & UX patterns for this Paired Check Challenge(PCC) would lay important groundwork by becoming a <span style="font-weight:700;">template for future Checkpoint Challenges</span>. As we expanded the library of self-guided activities, I was in charge of redesigning the Pair Check Activity experience.

        <h2>Learn from the Previous Version(V1)</h2>
        <p class="bodycopy1">
          Based off of the previously conducted diary study, I approached this problem from understanding success and failures. This research was a major breakthrough for me and allowed me to focus the energy on creating the right experience, this time.  Key takeaways that we found were:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Users' schedules are the root cause of people having difficulty.</li>
          <li>Functionality does not accommodate user schedules resulting in usability issues.</li>
          <li>Value drivers are not emphasized.</li>

        <img src="assets/onduoapp/paired-check-brainstorm.png" width="100%" alt="paired-check-hero">
        <p class="bodycopy1">After analyzing the strengths, it seemed logical to use the existing Framework we designed for other behavior modification and skill building exercises. If you see the framework below, we set proper expectations before asking people to try it out, and then they can schedule it at their convenient time. At the end of the activity, we provide them with useful insights that our members can take aways with. Moving forward, I continued to retain that <span style="font-weight:700;">the “Give-and-Take” rule</span>.</p>

        <h2>Redesign the Scheduling Experience</h2>
        <p class="bodycopy1">
          The app originally provides minimal amount of information what's included in the activity. However, using the existing framework, I separate the single screens into 2 separate screens so that people can focus on the contemt and expectations prior to schedule Paire Check Challenge. Although I explored more on other iterations for 'Schedule', we decided to reuse the Challenge component for this time. However, all my iterations still affected later improvements.

        <h2>Redesign the In-Progress Card</h2>
        <p class="bodycopy1">
          I initially wanted to provide a similar structure with the dynamic 'Log' button, and then ultimately decided to create a version that enables users to both 'Quit' and 'Reschedule' the Challenge. Lastly, I created a iteration that provides an easy option to 'Snooze' the Challenge instead of 'Quit'. In addition, our users reacted well to the large, inviting 'Log' button which only beecomes tappable when the time comes up. I also explored multiple other iterations with small to large tweaks, and they all affected to the fulture iterations.
