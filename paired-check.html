          This already starts to organize all the pieces that come with Diabetes Management into an understandable structure. The team combed through those 500+ pages of content & strategies the coaches were pulling from to create program maps for each pillar. Within each map, we identified strategies that could be delivered as lessons (read and learn) and those that could be delivered as activities (try something out).

          Managing feedback was even more challenging because everyone has different viewpoints. We spent a disproportionate amount of time debating design decisions, when there wasn’t data that helps drive decision.
