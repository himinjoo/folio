          To understand Walgreens Pill Reminder app’s ecosystem, I walked through the flow from onboarding to get a sense of how the app works and users’ expectations toward the product. Also, I could identify where might be the best place within the flow to insert the new paring flow. Also I learned the fundamental design language that set up in the interface.

          Before diving into the actual work, I first started off with research to get better understanding of the problem space. From this process, I could acknowledge main obstacles and problems of paper-based PRO trials. Knowing the problems and our potential users’ needs enabled me to have the proper mindset towards the problem space.

        <p class="bodycopy1">
          From the brainstorming session, we came up with several options for the history screen. Analyzing competitor’s UX patterns and research insights, we learned that people use dashboard to track todo lists and their health data. We wanted to make the home screen a place where users can create and track their medications, so we explored multiple versions that might be simple and straightforward for our end users to navigate through.

In addition, they were unclear about some information that is featured on the surface of the hardware device. We are currently making improvements to address those main concerns that came up during the 2nd round UX testing.
