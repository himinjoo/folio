          During the brainstorming session, we asked our selves many questions like “How might we reduce burden on our user side” and “How might we better motivate our end users?” In the beginning, we came up with (very) broad range of potential ideas, but we narrowed down and prioritized listed items. Then, we started setting our goals for the MVP version. While we dicussed, I roughly sketched how potential interface could be like so that we could visualize and spark the ideas more.<br><br>

          Initially, we imagined that the dashboard contains entrypoints to each day from day1 through the last day. However, this was not scalable solution for the future, becuase a clinical trial can lasts years while it could be a short study like this. Moving forward, we established the design principles to make sure that we were building a simple, scalable and functional product.

          I explored a few iterations of a lo-fi prototype and tested with six users which we then presented to the clinicians. I initially thought that featuring day-to-day journey on dashboard would help users understand where they are and where to go next. However, l then ultimately decided to create a version that was focused on today’s view with chronologically stacked lists of todos, from one that required an immediate action to others that are upcoming for the day. Lastly, I created cards with navigation that provides weekly overviews that provided clear guidance how our users could track and record their heath data.<br><br>
          I then narrowed in and selected those components that best solved for an intuitive dashboard experience to help guide users to complete assigned tasks for the day.

In addition, they were unclear about some information that is featured on the surface of the hardware device. We are currently making improvements to address those main concerns that came up during the 2nd round UX testing.
