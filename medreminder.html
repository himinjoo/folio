        Verily is building a hardware device, an app, and a console at pharmacies to help patients track and improve their medication adherence. This project was in the early development stage that required rapid design and validation through research and testing to deliver the app for a trial with a partner in early next year. Although the new flow will eventually be implemented to the partner's app, we needed to build a separate mobile app for this trial. While we were planning on doing first round usability testing, I was in charge of designing the user experiene of onboarding and "Create a Reminder" flows for the planned study.

          For initial launch, the experience had to encompass various scenarios of use. This includes for first-time users and for users who don't have certain settings like notification, camera access, or Bluetooth on.
