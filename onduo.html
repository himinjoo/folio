            Onduo, a joint venture between Verily and Sanofi,  is a virtual diabetes clinic. The mobile app supports its members with resources and tools to help them manage their disease. In order to do so, health coaches would sort through hundreds of google docs to find resources. They would then have to copy that content & send to their members via a messaging window. <span style="font-weight:700;">We needed to create a way to automate and deploy these strategies without coach intervention.</span><br><br>

            <span style="font-weight:700;">In the future world</span>,  the product automates the personalization process to help people experiment with different diabetes management tools to find what works for them and incorporate them into their lives.

          <p class="bodycopy1">Our system is based on the principles of <span style="font-weight:700;">Material Design (atomic design)</span>. The key idea behind the methodology is being small can be combined into larger molecular structures. The foundation loosely defined our typography, colors, iconography, spacing, navigation, and information architecture.  However, from time to time we had to <span style="font-weight:700;">break the rules (Material Design standards)</span>, such as font-size and button heights, to keep <span style="font-weight:700;">the accessibility</span> in the highest priority for our targeted customers. </p>

          <h2 style="padding-top: 80px;">Componentized Modular Illustration</h2>
          <p class="bodycopy1">
          From research, we found that our user group tends to rely heavily on visuals to understand the content. After discussions, we decided to use illustrations mainly and use photos for specific examples due to following reasons:
          <ul>
            <li>The visual requires many customizations depending on the content</li>
            <li>Buying stock photos is expensive</li>
            <li>Finding the perfect stock photos is difficult</li>
            <li>Illustration is more flexible and easily modifiable</li>
            <li>We can use illustrations to re-enforce our brand</li>
          </ul><br>
          I was in charge of creating illustrations. To make it more effective and scalable, I proposed creating modular illustrations. Since I created the initial set of 100+, the illustration library has naturally evolved as the product grows and with other designers' contributions.

          <p class="bodycopy1">
          The biggest challenge that I faced throughout the project was balancing designs with feedback, while collaborating with broader team. Since this new system would touch every part of our product, I needed to coordinate and get buy-in from the entire team. This was hard.<br><br>
          Managing feedback was even more challenging because everyone has different viewpoints. We spent a disproportionate amount of time debating design decisions, when there wasn’t data that helps drive decision.

          It's still early days for the feature, yet the results have exceeded our expectations. There still requires customization depending on the type of Challenge. Since the launch, we've developed several new UI & UX patterns for new Challenges. The component library is forever evolving.

          <p class="bodycopy1">
          This new design language has been used across all other Verily products as well. This wasn't expected, but it turned out to be a great asset for the whole organization. I started to question what it is like to design for healthcare products. How might we better design for people with various medical conditions? How can we improve accessibility for multiple platforms?

          The more eyes on a design, the more it is exposed to varying opinions, experience, and critique.
